# Implementation Plan Prompts

This document provides a set of prompts designed to guide AI coding agents in creating implementation plans. The prompts are based on the architectural patterns, service layer design, and development practices established in the project. They can be used as inputs to the `/create-implementation-plan` prompt to generate actionable tasks for agents.

## Release Testing Infrastructure
Develop a comprehensive test suite for release.ts that validates all release scenarios including multi-package tagging strategies (private root vs public packages), changeset processing, git operations, and error handling using Vitest with mocked GitHub API responses and filesystem operations. Integrate the test configuration into the existing vitest.config.ts workspace, create test fixtures for various package configurations, and implement CI validation that ensures release logic works correctly before deployment. Include edge case testing for missing tags, network failures, and malformed changeset files.

## Enhanced Renovate-Changesets Integration
Enhance the renovate-changesets action to intelligently parse Renovate changes from both `renovate/**` branches and PR contexts using the latest Renovate API patterns and commit message formats. Implement sophisticated change detection that categorizes updates by manager type (npm, lockfile, GitHub Actions, Docker), generates contextually appropriate changeset files with proper semver impact assessment, and automatically commits changes back to Renovate branches while updating associated PRs. Create comprehensive test scenarios covering all Renovate managers and update types, enable dogfooding within this repository, and ensure the action handles complex scenarios like grouped updates and security patches.

## Astro Starlight Documentation Platform
Create a modern documentation platform using Astro Starlight as a new monorepo package in docs that consolidates all existing documentation from workflows, GitHub instructions, and organizational guides into an intelligently organized, searchable knowledge base. Implement automated content migration, establish clear information architecture with proper cross-referencing, integrate with the existing build system and CI workflows, and follow Astro/Starlight best practices including performance optimization, accessibility compliance, and responsive design. Include automated deployment to GitHub Pages with proper domain configuration and search functionality.

## Federated Template Distribution System
Design and implement a sophisticated multi-organization template federation system using TypeScript that enables secure sharing and versioning of GitHub Actions workflow templates across organizational boundaries while maintaining individual sovereignty and security policies. Create a distributed governance model with template inheritance chains, automated conflict resolution mechanisms, security policy enforcement pipelines, and template deprecation lifecycle management. Implement a robust API for template discovery, version management, and compliance checking that includes automated testing of template compatibility across different organizational contexts and security requirements.

## Dynamic Workflow Composition Engine
Build an intelligent runtime workflow generation system that analyzes repository characteristics (detected languages, frameworks, dependencies, security requirements) and dynamically composes optimal GitHub Actions workflows from modular, reusable components using a sophisticated rule engine. Implement real-time workflow adaptation capabilities that respond to repository changes, automated A/B testing infrastructure for workflow optimization, and machine learning-driven performance analytics that continuously improve CI/CD efficiency across the organization. Include comprehensive monitoring, rollback mechanisms, and integration with existing security scanning and compliance requirements.

## Production Readiness Validation Framework
Develop a comprehensive go-live checklist and automated validation framework that systematically tests all packages, workflows, and integrations for production readiness including bundling verification, content completeness audits, deployment pipeline validation, runtime error detection, network failure resilience, and security compliance verification. Create reusable testing scenarios that can be applied to future iterations, implement automated health checks that run against staging and production environments, and establish clear criteria for deployment approval with rollback procedures for critical failures.

## Three Advanced Follow-Up Implementation Plan Prompts

**1. Intelligent Organizational Automation Orchestrator**: Design a meta-automation system that uses machine learning to analyze patterns across multiple GitHub organizations and automatically suggest, test, and deploy workflow optimizations, security policy updates, and development process improvements. Challenge the assumption that automation rules should be static by creating a self-evolving system that learns from real-world usage patterns, failure modes, and developer productivity metrics to continuously optimize organizational DevOps practices without human intervention.

**2. Cross-Platform Development Ecosystem Bridge**: Create a universal translation layer that converts GitHub Actions workflows into equivalent configurations for other CI/CD platforms (GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, Jenkins) while maintaining security policies and organizational standards. Investigate the real-world challenge of multi-platform development teams by building intelligent workflow pattern recognition and translation capabilities that enable organizations to maintain consistent development practices regardless of their chosen platform infrastructure.

**3. Regulatory Compliance Automation Engine**: Implement an advanced compliance framework that automatically adapts organizational workflows and security policies to meet evolving regulatory requirements (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, FedRAMP) through intelligent policy interpretation and automated control implementation. Challenge the assumption that compliance is a manual, reactive process by creating a proactive system that monitors regulatory changes, assesses organizational impact, and automatically implements necessary controls while maintaining development velocity and security posture.
