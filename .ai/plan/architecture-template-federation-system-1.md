## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Centralized template repository with organization-based access controls - rejected due to lack of organizational sovereignty and single point of failure concerns
- **ALT-002**: Git-based federation using submodules and webhooks - rejected due to complexity of conflict resolution and limited governance capabilities
- **ALT-003**: Blockchain-based governance system - rejected due to performance concerns and unnecessary complexity for the use case
- **ALT-004**: Marketplace model with template ratings and reviews - rejected as it doesn't address the core governance and security requirements
- **ALT-005**: Simple API gateway with template proxying - rejected due to lack of sophisticated governance and conflict resolution capabilities

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Complex distributed system coordination may lead to consistency issues and require sophisticated conflict resolution
- **RISK-002**: Security boundaries between organizations could be compromised through template injection or malicious content
- **RISK-003**: Performance degradation at scale due to cross-organization network latency and complex governance decisions
- **RISK-004**: Governance model adoption may be slow due to organizational resistance to sharing control
- **RISK-005**: Template compatibility issues across different organizational contexts and security requirements
- **RISK-006**: Supply chain security vulnerabilities in federated template dependencies

- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Organizations will adopt the distributed governance model and participate in template sharing
- **ASSUMPTION-002**: GitHub API rate limits and authentication mechanisms will support the required scale
- **ASSUMPTION-003**: Template consumers will accept the additional complexity of federated template resolution
- **ASSUMPTION-004**: Network connectivity between organizations will be reliable enough for real-time federation
- **ASSUMPTION-005**: Organizations will invest in proper security policy configuration and maintenance
- **ASSUMPTION-006**: Template creators will follow semantic versioning and deprecation best practices
- **ASSUMPTION-007**: The benefits of federated template sharing will outweigh the operational complexity
