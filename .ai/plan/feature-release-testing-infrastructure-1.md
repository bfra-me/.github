# Introduction

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This implementation plan outlines the development of a comprehensive test suite for the `scripts/release.ts` script that validates all release scenarios including multi-package tagging strategies, changeset processing, git operations, and error handling. The test suite will use Vitest with mocked GitHub API responses and filesystem operations, integrate with the existing test configuration, and include CI validation to ensure release logic works correctly before deployment.

## 1. Requirements & Constraints

- **REQ-001**: Test all release scenarios for both private root packages and public packages
- **REQ-002**: Validate multi-package tagging strategies with different naming conventions
- **REQ-003**: Mock all external dependencies (GitHub API, git operations, filesystem)
- **REQ-004**: Integration with existing vitest.config.ts workspace configuration
- **REQ-005**: Comprehensive edge case testing including network failures and malformed files
- **REQ-006**: CI validation pipeline that runs before release deployment
- **REQ-007**: Test fixtures for various package configurations and scenarios
- **REQ-008**: Coverage reporting for all release script functionality
- **SEC-001**: Ensure mocked credentials and sensitive data are not exposed in tests
- **SEC-002**: Validate that test mocks prevent actual git operations and API calls
- **CON-001**: Tests must run in isolated environments without affecting real repositories
- **CON-002**: Test execution time must be reasonable for CI pipeline integration
- **CON-003**: Tests must be deterministic and not rely on external network resources
- **GUD-001**: Follow existing TypeScript and testing patterns in the codebase
- **GUD-002**: Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate the scenario being tested
- **PAT-001**: Implement proper mock setup and teardown patterns for each test scenario

## 3. Alternatives

- **ALT-001**: Use Jest instead of Vitest - Rejected because the project already uses Vitest and maintains consistency
- **ALT-002**: Create real test repositories for integration testing - Rejected due to complexity and CI overhead
- **ALT-003**: Use Docker containers for isolated git testing - Rejected for this phase due to added complexity
- **ALT-004**: Implement end-to-end testing with real GitHub repositories - Deferred to future enhancement

## 4. Dependencies

- **DEP-001**: Vitest testing framework with mocking capabilities
- **DEP-002**: @actions/exec and @actions/core for GitHub Actions integration
- **DEP-003**: @changesets/config and related changeset dependencies
- **DEP-004**: @manypkg/get-packages for monorepo package management
- **DEP-005**: Node.js filesystem and process APIs for system operations
- **DEP-006**: GitHub CLI (gh) for API interactions (mocked in tests)

## 5. Files

- **FILE-001**: `vitest.config.ts` - Update configuration to include scripts directory
- **FILE-002**: `scripts/__tests__/release.test.ts` - Main test file for release script
- **FILE-003**: `scripts/__tests__/fixtures/` - Test fixture directory with sample configurations
- **FILE-004**: `scripts/__tests__/utils/` - Test utility functions and mock helpers
- **FILE-005**: `scripts/__tests__/mocks/` - Mock implementations for external dependencies
- **FILE-006**: `.github/workflows/test-release.yaml` - CI workflow for release testing
- **FILE-007**: `scripts/release.ts` - Source file (may need refactoring for testability)

## 6. Testing

- **TEST-001**: Unit tests for all exported functions with 100% code coverage
- **TEST-002**: Integration tests for complete release workflow scenarios

- **TEST-004**: Edge case tests for error conditions and failure modes
- **TEST-005**: Performance tests to ensure test execution time remains reasonable

## 7. Risks & Assumptions

- **RISK-001**: Release script may need refactoring to improve testability and modularity

- **RISK-003**: Test execution time could impact CI pipeline performance
- **RISK-004**: Changes to external dependencies might break mock implementations
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: Current release script functionality will remain stable during test development
