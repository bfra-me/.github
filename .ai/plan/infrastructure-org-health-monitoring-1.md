# Infrastructure: Organization Health Monitoring System

![Status: Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue)

This implementation plan outlines the development of a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system that leverages existing reusable workflows to create a centralized dashboard showing the health status of all repositories in the @bfra.me organization. The system will track security metrics, compliance status, and workflow adoption while providing automated alerts for repositories that fall below organizational thresholds.
