# Content Context Assessment

## Timeframe Classification

- **Current (Active) Content**
  - Ongoing work happening now
  - Uses present tense verbs or üîÑ status indicators
  - Contains action items for immediate implementation
  - *Belongs in:* Current Development Focus, Active Issues, Next Steps

- **Recent Content**
  - Completed within the last 1-2 weeks
  - Uses past tense verbs or ‚úÖ status indicators
  - Relevant to current development context
  - *Belongs in:* Recent Changes, Completed Tasks

- **Historical Content**
  - Completed more than 2 weeks ago
  - Important for context but not current focus
  - *Belongs in:* Lower sections of Completed Tasks, archived files

- **Planned Content**
  - Scheduled for future implementation
  - Not actively being worked on yet
  - *Belongs in:* Planned Tasks, organized by timeframe

## Context Assessment Protocol

1. **Analyze Content Timeframe:**
   - Identify temporal markers in the content
   - Determine whether work is active, complete, or planned
   - Assess relationship to current development focus

2. **Determine Appropriate Section:**
   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
       A[New Content] --> B{Timeframe?}
       B -->|Current| C[Current Development Focus / Next Steps]
       B -->|Recent| D[Recent Changes / Completed Tasks]
       B -->|Historical| E[Completed Tasks / Archive]
       B -->|Planned| F[Planned Tasks]
   ```

3. **Apply Progressive Disclosure:**
   - Most current information at the top of each section
   - Latest changes at the top of recent changes
   - Group related items together regardless of timeframe

## Content Migration Guidelines

- **When to move content:**
  - Current ‚Üí Recent: When work is completed
  - Recent ‚Üí Historical: After 2-4 weeks or when no longer relevant
  - Planned ‚Üí Current: When work begins

- **‚úÖ DO:**
  - Leave a transition note when moving significant content
  - Maintain references when content has dependencies
  - Update related sections when moving content

- **‚ùå DON'T:**
  - Delete historical content without confirmation
  - Move content without updating related references
  - Duplicate content across timeframes

## Content Consolidation Guidelines

- **When to Consolidate:**
  - Similar information appears in multiple sections
  - Related concepts are scattered across the document
  - Content has evolved to cover the same topics
  - Information granularity is inconsistent

- **Consolidation Process:**
  - Map related content across the document
  - Identify the primary location for each concept
  - Merge related content using coherent transitions
  - Add cross-references to related information
  - Remove redundant content after consolidation

- **Content Similarity Detection:**
  - Look for repeated terminology and phrases
  - Identify conceptually overlapping explanations
  - Check for similar examples or use cases
  - Review content with similar purposes

# Content Context Guidelines

Related Rules:
- @rule:cursor_rules (requires) - Base rule framework
- @rule:change_validation (complements) - Validates context updates
- @rule:knowledge_graph_management (impacts) - Affects knowledge representation

Version: 1.0.0

## Integration Points
1. Rule Cross-References
   - All referenced rules must include context markers
   - Context inheritance follows rule hierarchy
   - Context conflicts resolved using most restrictive timeframe

2. Validation Requirements
   - Context changes require change_validation approval
   - Major context shifts trigger rule dependency review
   - Context markers must be validated across rule chain

3. Knowledge Graph Alignment
   - Context updates propagate to linked knowledge nodes
   - Temporal relationships preserved in graph structure
   - Context boundaries enforced in graph queries
