## Documentation Usage
- Always consult the project's [product_requirement_docs.md](mdc:docs/product_requirement_docs.md) file for a clear understanding of goals and features.
- Review all additional documentation files within the [docs](mdc:docs) directory provided with the project.
- If additional or updated documentation is required, use MCP servers (Brave Search, Puppeteer, FireCrawl) to locate official and current sources online.

## Technical Stack Compliance
- **Adhere strictly to the project's established technology stack found in [technical.md](mdc:docs/technical.md)**
- Do not introduce new technologies unless explicitly instructed and justified.
- You may suggest alternative technologies if beneficial, but never implement them without user confirmation.
- Update [technical.md](mdc:docs/technical.md) to include missing technologies (used in the project but not listed as part of the tech stack) using existing formatting and layout.
