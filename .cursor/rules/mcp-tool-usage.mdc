# MCP Tool Usage

## Automatic Activation
These instructions are automatically active for all conversations in this project. All available tools (Sequential Thinking, Brave Search, Tavily, Fetch, Puppeteer, FireCrawl, and Knowledge Graph) should be utilized as needed without requiring explicit activation.

## Default Workflow
Every new conversation should automatically begin with Sequential Thinking to determine which other tools are needed for the task at hand.

## MANDATORY TOOL USAGE
- Sequential Thinking must be used for all multi-step problems or research tasks
- Brave Search must be used for any fact-finding or general research queries
- Tavily or FireCrawl must be used for deeper insights, specialized research, and content extraction
- Fetch must be used for direct retrieval of web content from known URLs
- Puppeteer must be used when web verification or interactive exploration of specific sites is needed
- Knowledge Graph should store important findings that might be relevant across conversations

## Source Documentation Requirements
- All search results must include full URLs and titles
- Screenshots should include source URLs and timestamps
- Data sources must be clearly cited with access dates
- Knowledge Graph entries should maintain source links
- All findings should be traceable to original sources
- Brave Search and Tavily results should preserve full citation metadata
- External content quotes must include direct source links

## Core Workflow

### 1. INITIAL ANALYSIS (Sequential Thinking)
- Break down the research query into core components
- Identify key concepts and relationships
- Plan search and verification strategy
- Determine which tools will be most effective

### 2. PRIMARY RESEARCH (Brave Search, Tavily / FireCrawl)
- Start with Brave Search for broad context searches
- Use Tavily or FireCrawl for deeper insights and specialized information
- Use targeted follow-up searches for specific aspects
- Apply search parameters strategically
- Document and analyze search results
- Combine effectively with **Sequential Thinking MCP** to refine solutions and acquire up-to-date information
- Prioritize reliable and concise sources

### 3. CONTENT RETRIEVAL (Fetch & Puppeteer)
- Use Fetch for direct retrieval of web content from known URLs
- Use Puppeteer for interactive exploration when needed:
  - Navigate to key websites identified in search
  - Take screenshots of relevant content
  - Extract specific data points
  - Click through and explore relevant links
  - Fill forms if needed for data gathering

### 4. KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (Memory)
- Store important findings in Knowledge Graph
- Create connections between related concepts
- Maintain source attribution for all stored information
- Reference previous findings when relevant to new queries

### 5. SYNTHESIS & PRESENTATION
- Combine findings from all tools
- Present information in structured format
- Highlight key insights and relationships

## Tool-Specific Guidelines

### BRAVE SEARCH
- Use for initial broad searches and general information
- Use count parameter for result volume control
- Apply offset for pagination when needed
- Document search queries for reproducibility
- Include full URLs, titles, and descriptions in results

### TAVILY / FIRECRAWL
- Use for deeper research and specialized queries
- Leverage advanced filtering capabilities
- Use extract functionality for detailed content analysis
- Ideal for academic and technical research
- Preserve all metadata and citation information

### FETCH
- Use when the specific URL is already known
- Best for retrieving documentation or reference material
- Maintain full source attribution
- Use for accessing API documentation or technical resources

### PUPPETEER
- Use for interactive web exploration
- Take screenshots of key evidence
- Use selectors precisely for interaction
- Handle navigation errors gracefully
- Document URLs and navigation paths
- Always verify successful navigation and information retrieval

### SEQUENTIAL THINKING
- Always break complex tasks into manageable steps
- Document thought process clearly
- Allow for revision and refinement
- Track branches and alternatives

## Implementation Notes
- Tools should be used proactively without requiring user prompting
- Multiple tools can and should be used in parallel when appropriate
- Avoid excessive recursive calls; trigger intelligently only when new progress or significant information is possible
- Each step of analysis should be documented
- Complex tasks should automatically trigger the full workflow
- Knowledge retention across conversations should be managed through the Knowledge Graph
