# Memory Files Management

- **Related Rules:**
  - [knowledge-graph.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/knowledge-graph.mdc) (complements) - Semantic information storage
  - [content-context.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/content-context.mdc) (requires) - Temporal context management
  - [change-validation.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/change-validation.mdc) (requires) - Change validation protocol

## Activation Patterns
- "update memory files": Trigger memory file updates
- "document current state": Record current project state
- "refresh documentation": Update all relevant memory files
- "capture project context": Store comprehensive context

  ```

## Knowledge Graph Integration

### Entity Representation
- **Create entities for memory files**
  - Type: `DocumentEntity`
  - Purpose: Store metadata about documentation
  - Relations: Connect to related components

- **Link documentation to components**
  - Create bidirectional relationships
  - Track documentation coverage
  - Monitor update requirements

### Content Tracking
- **Extract key concepts as entities**
  - Create component entities from architecture docs
  - Extract requirements as requirement entities
  - Link tasks to requirements

- **Store documentation update history**
  - Track changes over time
  - Record rationale for changes
  - Monitor evolution of documentation

## File Content Guidelines

- **All memory files must follow standard templates**
  - See [memory-templates.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/memory-templates.mdc) for required templates
  - Templates ensure consistent structure across all memory files
  - Variations must maintain the core structure while extending as needed

## Documentation Integration Best Practices

- **✅ DO:**
  - Integrate new content within the existing structure
  - Update affected sections throughout the document
  - Maintain narrative flow when adding information
  - Revise surrounding content to accommodate updates
  - Use consistent terminology across updates

  ```markdown
  ## Before:
  ### Component Architecture
  - Component A handles authentication
  - Component B manages user sessions

  ## After (integrated update):
  ### Component Architecture
  - Component A handles authentication and identity verification
  - Component B manages user sessions and state persistence
  - Component C coordinates between A and B for security enforcement
  ```

- **❌ DON'T:**
  - Simply append new information at the end of sections
  - Add content without revising affected areas
  - Create sections that duplicate existing information
  - Break narrative flow with isolated updates

### Content Context Management
- **Content must be placed in appropriate contexts:**
  - See [content-context.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/content-context.mdc) for context classification
  - Apply progressive disclosure principle (most current/relevant information first)
  - Maintain contextual relationship between related content
  - Migrate content between sections as timeframes change

### [product_requirement_docs.md](mdc:docs/product_requirement_docs.md)
- **✅ DO:**
  - Keep problem statements clear and concise
  - Update scope as project evolves
  - Maintain clear success criteria

  ```

- **❌ DON'T:**
  - Include temporary workarounds
  - Mix with task planning

## Maintenance Best Practices

- **Regular Reviews:**
  - Ensure all Core Files are up-to-date before starting new work
  - Review for consistency across documents
  - Validate architectural decisions against implementation

- **Change Validation:**
  - Apply [change-validation.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/change-validation.mdc) protocol to all memory file updates
  - Perform structural validation before submitting changes
  - Review content flow to ensure logical organization
  - Validate cross-reference integrity across files

## Cross-Reference Management

- **Cross-Reference Types:**
  - **Direct Links:** Explicit links to other memory files
  - **Conceptual References:** Mentions of related topics
  - **Dependency References:** Links to files this document depends on
  - **Implementation References:** Links to code or examples

- **Cross-Reference Best Practices:**
  - Include brief context with each cross-reference
  - Verify all cross-references are valid before committing
  - Use bidirectional references where appropriate
  - Group related cross-references logically

- **Cross-Reference Syntax:**
  ```markdown
  - Related architecture: [Component Architecture](/docs/architecture.md#component-architecture)
  - See also: [Error Handling](/.cursor/rules/error-management.mdc) for exception patterns
  - Implementation: [Authentication Flow](/src/auth/README.md)
  ```

## Version History Management

- **Version Tracking Requirements:**
  - All memory files should include version history for significant changes
  - Track major content revisions, structural changes, and architectural decisions
  - Document rationale behind changes, not just the changes themselves
  - Preserve historical context while maintaining current accuracy

- **Version History Template:**
  ```markdown
  ## Version History

  ### 2023-11-15: Major Update
  - **Changes:** Restructured authentication workflow to support OAuth 2.0
  - **Rationale:** Improved security and third-party integration support
  - **Affected Sections:** Authentication Components, API Endpoints
  - **Related Documents:** [OAuth Design RFC](/tasks/rfc/oauth-design.md)
  ```

- **✅ DO:**
  - Track version history consistently across all memory files
  - Document rationale for significant changes
  - Preserve historical evolution while keeping content current
  - Link version history entries to related documentation
  - Include version headers for critical documents

- **❌ DON'T:**
  - Track trivial changes that don't affect meaning or structure
  - Remove historical context that explains current design decisions
  - Let version histories grow excessively long (consider archiving older entries)
  - Include detailed implementation notes better suited for commit messages

## Rule Preprocessing Integration

- **Rule Preprocessing Application:**
  - Apply preprocessing principles from [rule-preprocessing.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/rule-preprocessing.mdc) to ensure:
    - Rules are consistently structured
    - Dependencies between rules are properly managed
    - Rules are applied in the correct sequence
    - Memory file updates follow standardized metadata patterns

- **Memory File Rule Processing:**
  ```mermaid
  flowchart TD
      Start[Memory File Update] --> Load[Load Rule Files]
      Load --> Preprocess[Apply Rule Preprocessing]
      Preprocess --> Filter[Filter Relevant Rules]
      Filter --> Order[Order by Dependencies]
      Order --> Execute[Execute Rule Application]
      Execute --> Validate[Validate Results]
      Validate --> Document[Document Changes]
  ```

- **Rule Dependency Management:**
  - Memory files should track their rule dependencies
  - Include rule version information when referencing rules
  - Use standardized metadata structure for all memory file entries

- **Rule-Memory File Synchronization:**
  - Memory files should reflect current rule state
  - Update memory files when rules change
  - Validate memory file content against current rule requirements
  - Document rule application in memory file change history
