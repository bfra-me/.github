# [DEPRECATED] Planning Workflow

> **IMPORTANT: This file is deprecated.**
>
> The planning workflow guidelines previously contained in this file have been consolidated into the comprehensive [development-workflow.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/development-workflow.mdc) document.
>
> Please refer to the **Planning Phase** section in development-workflow.mdc for the current planning guidelines.
>
> This file will be removed in a future update.

1. UNDERSTAND the REQUIREMENTS:
<CLARIFICATION>
- Always ask for clarifications and follow-ups.
- Identify underspecified requirements and ask for detailed information.
- Fully understand all the aspects of the problem and gather details to make it very precise and clear.
- Ask towards all the hypothesis and assumptions needed to be made. Remove all the ambiguities and uncertainties.
- Suggest solutions that I didn't think about, i.e. anticipate my needs and things to be specified.
- Only after having hundred percent clarity and confidence, proceed for SOLUTION.
</CLARIFICATION>

2. FORMULATING the SOLUTION:
<STEP BY STEP REASONING>
<DECOMPOSE>
- Have a meta architecture plan for the solution.
- Break down the problem into key concepts and smaller sub-problems.
</DECOMPOSE>
a. Think about all possible ways to solve the problem.
b. Set up the evaluation criteria and trade-offs to access the merit of the solutions.
c. Find the optimal solution and the criteria making it optimal and the trade-offs involved.
<WEB USE> Can use the web if needed using use_mcp_tool commands, particularly use the search tool from Perplexity. Example:
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>perplexity-mcp</server_name>
<tool_name>search</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "param1": "value1",
  "param2": "value2"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
</WEB USE>

<MULTI ATTEMPTS>
a. Reason out rigorously about the optimality of the solution.
b. Question every assumption and inference, and support them with comprehensive reasoning.
c. Think of better solutions than the present one Combining the strongest aspects of different solutions.
d. Repeat the process <MULTI ATTEMPTS> refining and integrating different solutions into one until a strong solution is found.
d. Can use <WEB USE> if needed to do research.
</MULTI ATTEMPTS>
</STEP BY STEP REASONING>

3. SOLUTION VALIDATION:

<REASONING PRESENTATION>
- Provide the PLAN with as much detail as possible.
- Break down the solution step-by-step and think every step in through detail with clarity.
- Reason out its optimality w.r.t. other promising solutions.
- Explicitly tell all your assumptions, choices and decisions
- Explain trade-offs in solutions
- restate my query in your own words if necessary after giving the solution
</REASONING PRESENTATION>
- Before implementing, validate the SOLUTION plan produced by <REASONING PRESENTATION>.
