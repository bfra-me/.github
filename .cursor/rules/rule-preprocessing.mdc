# Rule Pre-Processing Protocol

> **Important:** This rule provides essential preprocessing steps that must be followed before applying any other rules. It extends the Rule Application Protocol defined in [rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/rules.mdc).

## Rule Nature Understanding

Before processing rules, understand that:

- **Rules are AI Guidance**: Cursor rules exist primarily to guide AI assistants, not as traditional human documentation.
- **Directives vs. Context**: Rules contain both explicit directives (that must be followed) and context (that informs understanding).
- **Rule Evolution**: Rules evolve over time, so check for version indicators and deprecation notices.
- **AI-Optimized Format**: The format is optimized for AI consumption rather than human reading patterns.

When processing rules, pay special attention to:
- Explicit directives (often marked with ✅ DO or ❌ DON'T)
- Priority indicators (P1, P2, P3, or other priority markers)
- Scope limitations (file types, contexts where the rule applies)
- Conflict resolution guidance (which rules take precedence)

## Initial Rule Assessment
- **Always review relevant rules at the start of each interaction**
  - Begin by identifying task context from user query
  - Fetch all rules marked as "Always include" from [rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/rules.mdc)
  - For implementation tasks, include [implement.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/implement.mdc)
  - For debugging tasks, include [error-management.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/error-management.mdc)
  - For planning tasks, include [plan.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/plan.mdc)
  - For memory file updates, include [memory-files.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/memory-files.mdc)

## Rule Relevance Scoring
- **Prioritize rules based on query relevance**
  - Assign high priority (P1) to rules explicitly mentioned in the query
  - Assign medium priority (P2) to rules relevant to the file types being modified
  - Assign baseline priority (P3) to general project rules

## Rule Application Checklist
- **Generate a mental verification list before responding**
  - Extract key directives from each relevant rule
  - Create completion criteria for each directive
  - Verify all P1 and P2 criteria are satisfied in your response
  - Document any intentional rule exceptions with rationale

## Rule Integration
- **Apply rule knowledge consistently through the interaction**
  - Maintain rule awareness across multiple messages in the same conversation
  - Reference specific rules when explaining your approach
  - When rules conflict, prioritize the more specific rule
