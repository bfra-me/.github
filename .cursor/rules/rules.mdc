# @bfra-me/.github - Cursor Rule Management

This document serves as the central reference for all Cursor rule management within the @bfra-me/.github repository, providing AI assistants with a comprehensive framework for applying, validating, and maintaining project-specific guidelines across development contexts.

## AI Consumption Model

Cursor rules are specifically designed to be consumed by AI assistants operating within the Cursor IDE environment. They serve as contextual guidance that helps AI agents:

- **Understand Project Context**: Rules provide AI agents with project-specific information that may not be inferrable from code alone.
- **Follow Consistent Patterns**: Rules establish consistent patterns for AI responses across different interactions.
- **Apply Domain Knowledge**: Rules encode domain-specific knowledge relevant to the project.
- **Prioritize Requirements**: Rules help AI agents understand which requirements take precedence.

### Key Distinctions from Human Documentation

- **Directive-Focused**: Rules emphasize clear directives that can be parsed and applied by AI agents.
- **Context-Sensitive**: Rules include markers for when they should be applied or ignored.
- **AI-Optimized Structure**: Content is structured to facilitate AI comprehension rather than human reading flow.
- **Explicit Prioritization**: Rules include explicit priority information to resolve conflicts.

### Rule Consumption Process

1. **Rule Loading**: AI assistant loads relevant rules based on context
2. **Rule Prioritization**: Rules are prioritized based on relevance to the current query
3. **Rule Application**: AI applies rule directives to generate responses
4. **Rule Verification**: AI validates its output against rule requirements

All rule improvements should consider this AI-centric consumption model to ensure they enhance the ability of AI assistants to effectively apply project guidelines.

   - When a rule is deleted

2. **Rule Description Changes**
   - When a rule's primary purpose or scope changes significantly
   - When a rule's description becomes outdated or inaccurate
   - When a rule's functionality expands or contracts

### How to Update the Index

1. **Adding New Rules**
   ```markdown
   | Rule File | Description | Category |
   |-----------|-------------|----------|
   | **[`new-rule.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/new-rule.mdc)** | Brief description of the rule's purpose | System Architecture |
   ```
   - Place the entry in alphabetical order in the Rule Index
   - Use the exact filename in the link
   - Keep descriptions concise and focused on the primary purpose
   - Add the rule to the appropriate category in the Rule Index
     - Create a new category if none exists
     - Add the rule to the correct section of the category

2. **Updating Descriptions**
   - Preserve the link format
   - Update only the description part
   - Maintain consistent tone and length with other entries

3. **Removing Rules**
   - Remove the entire entry for deleted rules
   - Update any references to the removed rule in other rules

### Validation Steps

1. **Before Updating**
   - Verify the rule file exists in `.cursor/rules/`
   - Check the rule's frontmatter for the official description
   - Review recent changes to understand the context

2. **After Updating**
   - Verify alphabetical ordering
   - Check link formatting
   - Ensure consistent style with other entries
   - Validate all links are working

### Integration with Other Rules

- Follow formatting guidelines from [cursor-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor-rules.mdc)
- Apply content context principles from [content-context.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/content-context.mdc)
- Follow change validation process from [change-validation.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/change-validation.mdc)

### Maintenance Checklist

✅ Verify all rules in `.cursor/rules/` are listed
✅ Ensure descriptions match current rule purposes
✅ Check for consistent formatting and style
✅ Validate all rule links
✅ Update related rules if references change
