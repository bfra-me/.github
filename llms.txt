# @bfra-me/.github

> Central configuration hub and template repository for the @bfra-me GitHub organization, providing reusable workflows, organizational standards, development tooling, and community health files.

This repository serves as both a template for creating new .github repositories and the central configuration point for organization-wide settings. It standardizes development practices, automates repository maintenance through GitHub Actions workflows, and enforces security best practices across all repositories in the organization.

Key features include automated dependency management via Renovate, repository settings synchronization, release management with Changesets, comprehensive security scanning, and AI-optimized development guidance through the Cursor rules system.
